				Orginally I had a more experimental and bare site, but
				 now I am trying to add more content to each page and
				 actually do something useful with this site.

			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>
				My name is Joshua Thompson and I am a Hobbyist/Freelance
				 Programmer and Musician. I toy with programming,
				 general hacking, game modding, reverse engineering, 
				 digital art and animation.<br><br>

				I enjoy complex puzzles and spend a lot of time studying
				 obscure file formats.<br><br>

				I am semi-fluent in Japanese. I can read, write, and 
				 communicate conversationally without much assistance.<br><br>

				I would like to learn other languages as well, Hebrew, Greek,
				 French, Portuguese, and possibly Tagalog, Hiligaynon, Russian,
				 and Bulgarian. My favorite languages are languages that use 
				 non-latin scripts.<br><br>

				Programming Languages that I am most familiar with are C, C++,
				 and Python. I am also familiar with HTML, PHP, MySQL, XML, 
				 Javascript, Lua, CSS, C#, Java, and Assembly 
				 (x86, x86_64, and ARM)<br><br>

				I have also been known to do Architectural CAD from time to time.
