			<h3>Overview</h3>
			<p>Japanese is a difficult language to get started with but easier
				than you would expect.<br><br>

				first you should learn and memorize the writing systems
				 <strong><a href="hiragana.html">Hiragana</a></strong>
				 and <strong><a href="katakana.html">Katakana</a></strong>
				 along with general pronunciation. There is a third writing
				 system, <strong>Kanji</strong>, which you will spend your 
				 whole life learning, so don't stress over it too much. :)

			<h3>The Syllabary <i>"Gojuuon"</i></h3>
			<p>
				As stated before, Japanese has Three writing systems. There is no 
				 Alphabet unless you count <b>Romaji</b> which is just English letters, but
				 Romaji serves little purpose in actual Japanese.<br><br>

				Hiragana and Katakana are mostly just mirrors of each other. They represent
				 the same sounds, but are used for slightly different purposes. Hiragana is
				 used mostly for grammar points, but is also used for certain native Japanese
				 words. Katakana on the other hand is either used for foreign loan words or to
				 indicate vulgarity in certain instances.<br><br>

				Both Hiragana and Katakana both represent the Japanese Syllablary, the
				 <b>Gojuuon「五十音」</b> or the "Fifty Sounds". Each character in the 
				 Gojuuon represents a syllable and not a letter. The difference is that a syllable
				 is like a consonant and vowel combined, but a letter is either a representation of
				 an individual consonant or vowel. In Japanese the syllables also do not have names
				 separate from their pronunciation. In other words, the name of each syllable is the
				 same as its pronunciation.

			<h3>Kanji</h3>
			<p>
				The third writing system of Japanese is <b>Kanji</b>. Kanji is used to represent
				 most words in Japanese. It is neither an alphabet nor a syllabary meaning you must
				 memorize how each word or reading in context. Kanji stands for ideas and not sounds.
				 While I did state that kanji does not represent a sound, there are different readings
				 associated with the kanji in different contexts
