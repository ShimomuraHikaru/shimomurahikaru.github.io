			<h2>Information On Japanese</h2>
			<p>Japanese is a difficult language to get started with but easier
				than you would expect.<br><br>

				first you should learn and memorize the writing systems
				 <strong><a href="hiragana.html">Hiragana</a></strong>
				 and <strong><a href="katakana.html">Katakana</a></strong>
				 along with general pronunciation. There is a third writing
				 system, <strong>Kanji</strong>, which you will spend your 
				 whole life learning, so don't stress over it too much. :)
