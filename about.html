			<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Although I go by Hikaru Shimomora on the internet,my name is Joshua Thompson.
I want to use this site to host my projects and hopefully as a portfolio to
kickstart my career as a developer.
			
Languages that I have studied include:
	C, C++, Java, Python, HTML, and CSS
			
I am very familar with 3D Graphics Software, and while I am not fluent,
I can communicate fairly well in Japanese.</p>
